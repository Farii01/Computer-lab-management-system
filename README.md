# Computer-lab-management-system
The code you shared is a Python script designed to help manage PCs in a lab setting. It provides a simple and intuitive interface for performing various tasks related to the PCs in the lab. With this script, you can easily add new PCs by entering their number, installed operating system, and status. If a PC with the same number already exists, the script gives you options to modify its information or remove it entirely. You can also display information about all the PCs in the lab, which includes their PC number, installed operating system, and status. In addition, you have the option to search for a specific PC by entering its number. If the PC is found, the script displays its detailed information. If it's not found, you have the choice to add it to the lab or exit the program.
The script allows you to store all the PC information to a file named "lab_pcs.txt". This feature helps in maintaining a record of the lab's PCs for future reference or documentation purposes.
By providing a menu-based interface, the script ensures a user-friendly experience. Each option corresponds to a specific task, such as adding a PC, updating its information, removing it, or storing the PC details. The program continues to prompt for choices until you decide to quit.
In summary, this Python script simplifies the management of lab PCs, making it easy to add, update, remove, search, and store information about the PCs. It can be a valuable tool for lab administrators or technicians who need an efficient and organized way to handle their PC inventory.
